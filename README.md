This project is simple, but has several tools used in the production of large projects, is fully responsive and has integrations with JavaScript libraries and CDNs
I took 2 days to make this and the template is from Alura courses.

Tools:
- CSS3
(FlexBox, Position tricks, Responsive)
- HTML
(Semantic, External links)
- JavaScript
(Carousel with slick library - https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

Thank you all! :)
